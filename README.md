# FYP-reinforcementlearning
4th Year Project: A Handbook to Reinforcement Learning based on Sutton and Barto and David Silver 

In the final year of my data science degree I independently created a condensed guide to reinforcement learning, with simple non-technical introductions as well as an explanation of mathematical techniques. This was alongside the practical Python coding of a reinforcement learning card game based on David Silver's Reinforcement Learning course: https://www.deepmind.com/learning-resources/introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-with-david-silver
