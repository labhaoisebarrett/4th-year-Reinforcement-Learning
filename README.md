# Final Year Project: A Handbook to Reinforcement Learning based on Sutton and Barto and David Silver 
In the final year of my data science degree I independently created a condensed guide to reinforcement learning, with simple non-technical introductions as well as an explanation of mathematical techniques. 
I followed a course designed by David Silver for DeepMind and taught at UCL. Then implementing my knowledge through Python code allowed me to show just how powerful reinforcement learning could be.
